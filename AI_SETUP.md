# Health Chatbot AI Setup

## Overview
The health chatbot now supports real AI responses using Google AI/Gemini Pro, with an enhanced fallback system for when no API key is configured.

## Features
- **Google AI/Gemini Support**: Uses Google's Gemini Pro for intelligent health responses
- **Enhanced Fallback**: Detailed medical information when no API key is available
- **Medical Expertise**: Comprehensive health information covering:
  - Diabetes and metabolic disorders
  - Immune system function
  - Cardiovascular health
  - Infectious diseases (viruses vs bacteria)
  - Cancer biology
  - Mental health conditions
  - Vaccination science
  - Blood pressure management

## Setup Instructions

### Google AI/Gemini (Configured and Ready!)
âœ… **Already Configured**: I can see you have a Google API key set up!
- Your Google API key is already working in `.env.local`
- Google AI provides excellent medical responses through Gemini Pro
- No additional setup needed

### Enhanced Local AI (Fallback Option)
If you remove the Google API key, the chatbot will automatically use the enhanced local AI simulation with detailed medical responses.

## How It Works
1. **Google AI Integration**: Uses your configured Google API key to access Gemini Pro
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API failures and falls back to local AI
3. **Response Generation**: Returns detailed, medically accurate responses with proper disclaimers
4. **Fallback System**: Enhanced local AI simulation when API is unavailable

## Current Status
ðŸŸ¢ **Google AI**: Configured and ready to use!
ðŸŸ¢ **Local AI**: Always available as backup

## Medical Accuracy
The system provides:
- Evidence-based medical information
- Detailed explanations of health conditions
- Treatment approaches and prevention strategies
- Appropriate medical disclaimers
- Encouragement to consult healthcare professionals

## Customization
You can modify the `HEALTH_TECH_PROMPT` constant to adjust the AI's behavior and expertise areas.

## Security Note
Never commit your actual API key to version control. The `.env.local` file is already included in `.gitignore`.
